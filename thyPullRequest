So each company has it own rules, in my projects latley, I just follow this. 

I am assuming you know theRuleNo1: each task/feature/bug you work on, has to have a ticket Number(else don't work)
then
Create a branch for that task/feature/bug with the ticket number and then start working. 

Before making a pull request:
1) Check for yourself(in sourcecontrol or commandline or wherever) the changes you made are valid things related 
to that Ticket you are working on.
2) Take care of code structuring, indenting and basic coding guidelines
3) Make a pull request 
4) Test, Test, Test & Test again 
5) Analyze for the last time, how this code change will affect other apects of app
6) Anticipate tentative question related to the pull request 
7) Submit the pull request.

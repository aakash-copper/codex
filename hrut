Harrys Rule of Thumb 

1) If you alloc, retain or copy = release, auto release 

2) If you have to copy the same code again, make a function

3) Reduce code dependenies 

4) Try to avoid global variables, because they remain in memory and other file with same name global variable will
cause memory ambiguity. 


Other Conventions

1) While naming variables make sure that they describe the content. Never go with names like, firstSetOfKeys, 
secondDictionary etc, rather use, countryInformation, playerInformation etc. 

2) Debugging: Analyze slowly. (Eg picker bug, of getting all keys rather the entire dictionary)

Harrys Rule of Thumb 

1) If you alloc, retain or copy = release, auto release 

2) If you have to copy the same code again, make a function

3) Reduce code dependenies 

4) Try to avoid global variables, because they remain in memory and other file with same name global variable will
cause memory ambiguity.
